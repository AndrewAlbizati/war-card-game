# War Card Game

This is a simple Python program that simulates the card game War between two bot players. Simply run ```game.py``` and a game will be simulated. Occasionally the deck will be shuffled in a way where the game will last forever, and in cases like this, the program will automatically timeout after 15 seconds.
